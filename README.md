# mpg-foss-alpha α
 Python code to assist in the data collection and usage of FOSS implementations.

 - `deps` gets required modules.
 - `data` starts gator hardware data retrieval.
 - `sim` starts usb gator data output simulation.

 - Use the `foss.py` script in the root directory to execute commands.
 - `foss.py help` to list commands.

## Notes:

### Unit Conversion:
The central wavelengths (CoG bit numbers) that are generated by the Gator are absolute, calibrated central wavelengths in the operating range of the gator. To make full use of the available 18 bit register, the following conversion can be used to determine the actual central wavelength `λCW` in nm.

`$$ λ_{CW} = {1514 + CoG_{bit}} / {2^{18} * 72} $$`

In order to determine the strain `ε` or temperature change `ΔT` induced on an FBG sensor, one first has to know the default central wavelength value[^†] (unstrained / room Temperature) for the particular sensor, defined as λ0...  The relation between wavelength and strain and temperature is then as followed:

`$$ ∆λ_0 = {1-pe∙ε+-nT} $$`

Here `pe` is the strain-optic coefficient (0.22 for a glass fiber), `ε` the strain, `αΛ` the thermal expansion coefficient, αn thermo-optic coefficient and `ΔT` the induced temperature change.  For a bare glass fiber the temperature dependence `∆λ/ΔT` is typically in the order of 10 pm/°C at 1550 nm wavelength.

[^†]: The central wavelength and strain conversion are implemented in the software as options for the plots.
